# Intestinal Motility Modeling

This repository contains the COMSOL simulation models used in the study:

**"Mechanics of Small Intestine Motility for Oral Macromolecular Delivery: Modeling Segmentation Versus Peristalsis"**

## Contents

- `peristalsis.mph`: COMSOL model simulating macromolecular transport under peristaltic motility.
- `segmentation.mph`: COMSOL model simulating macromolecular transport under segmental motility.

Each model incorporates representative geometries, motility patterns, boundary conditions, and parameter settings used in the main manuscript.

## Description

These models simulate the influence of intestinal motility (peristalsis and segmentation) on the transport and colocalization of macromolecules and permeation enhancers at the epithelial surface. Key parameters such as occlusion ratio, pocket volume, mucus thickness, and fluid type are embedded in the file settings and can be modified in COMSOL’s GUI.

## Usage

Open each `.mph` file using **COMSOL Multiphysics**.  
We recommend reviewing the *Definitions* and *Study* branches within the model tree for a complete overview of simulation parameters and solver settings.
